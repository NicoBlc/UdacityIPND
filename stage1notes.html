<!-- The <h1> tag... most important heading for an article  -->
<h1>Wow... the interwebs is so cool!</h1>

<h2>History of the interwebs and how the technology works</h2>
   <p>So yeah...I went to wikipedia...turns out the
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">world wide web has quite some history<a/>.
  Some guy named Tim Berners Lee invented the internet. In essence the world wide web is just a bunch of text files sitting on computer servers
  all linked together and approachable through Domain Name Servers (DNS). Where the domain name is sort of the home adress where you live.
  To visit an adress you need a webbrowser. Webbrowsers display client side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.).
  The code files stored on the server are... server side code (PHP, Python, Ruby etc.). Often ther are also databases involved (SQL or no-SQL).
  So yeah, I sort of have an basic understanding of the interwebs.

<!-- HTML is an important building block of the internet  -->
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML is <em>the common language</em> browsers speak. It is not a programming language, but more a markup language that structures webpages.
  <br>
  You can also add hippmunks <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk!"> to lines of text.
  This is an example of inline html elements.
  <br>
  There are also block elements like a div.
  Div's (block) and span's (inline) are container elements to structure the html.
</p>

<!-- CSS is another important building block of the internet  -->
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>Another cool technology is CSS it provides pretty design and floating blocks for example:</p>
  <div class="floating-box">Floating box</div>
<p>
With HTML we control structure and with CSS we control the design.
Boxifying a Photoshop design is a commen practise.
Those div's get a class or id name to use CSS styling on later.
</p>

<!-- JavaScript is another important building block of the internet  -->
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>
JavaScript is not to be confused with the Java programming language.
JavaScript is a scripting language we can use for writing client side code in browsers.
</p>

<p>One example is you can can create jquery buttons:</p>
<br>
<button id="button-1">A button element</button>
<input id="button-2" type="submit" value="A submit button">
<a id="button-3" href="">An anchor</a>
<input type="checkbox"  id="button-4" >
<label for="button-4">Toggle</label>
<br>
<br>
<div id="button-5">
    <input type="checkbox" id="check1">
    <label for="check1">Left</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="check2">
    <label for="check2">Middle</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="check3">
    <label for="check3">Right</label>
</div>


<h3>Wrapping it up</h3>
<p>As you can see I can mess around a bit with webpages already.</p>
